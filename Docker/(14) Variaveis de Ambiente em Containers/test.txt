She steps from a pain
just a mnona with extra touchaof crazy
she dances in the rain
and as tehe storm begins
the thunder is her name
ant when she locks my way 
my heart begins to sway
in the imphony her love
she's a perfect melody 
her music lifts me up 
i can feel it in my soul 
the beauty of it all
the simphony of love
she plays like a song
and i'm a willin instrument
dhe plucks my strings along
and i feel like a king
when i hold her close
i can fell angle wings
and when she holds mu hand 
i know thai i can't stand
in the simphony oh her love
